# About Me
## My Interests

  ### Academic Interests:
  * I love both computers and environmental science. In fact, I have an Bachlor of Science in Enivironmental Technology and Management.
    Overtime though, I realized that a career in computers is more inline with _who I am_ and my aspirations. Upon this realization, I changed career fields and am now pursing an Associate in Computer Programming at Wake Tech.
    
  ### Hobbies:
  * <ins>Computers</ins>: I enjoy working with computer hardware, such as building computers. For example, one of the computers I have built was a server for my house.
  * <ins>Books</ins>: I love to read! I mostly read speculative fiction, with leanings toward horror.
  * <ins>Writing</ins>: I also occasionally write fiction, but nothing serious at the moment. I would love to write a novel in the future if I have the time.
  * <ins>Video Games</ins>: I play video games of pretty much every genre except multiplayer or sports. I tend to play games that are singleplayer with a focus on story.
